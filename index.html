                  <h3 class="who2-content">Women Across Borders was founded in 2008 by Kave Bishogo, a refugee from the Democratic Repub lic of Congo who moved to Central Durban, South Africa, six years ago. <br><br>
                     As a young woman who has experienced much strife and hardship herself, Kave wanted to give something back to the community she was living in, and thus, Women Across Borders was born in response to the huge need in Central Durban’s large refugee community for empowerment projects to meet the needs of those who do not have the nece ssary life and communication skills to get jobs and make a sustainable living for themselves. <br><br>
                  <h4>The central ethos of the organization is to ensure the wellbeing of refugee women and assist them in helping their families by creating a platform to learn and access social and economic opportunities. </h4>
                  <br><br>
                  <h4>We are an inclusive multi-cultural organization, purposely attracting and reaching out to women from all sectors of society. <br><br>
                     In many ways, Women Across Borders is a grassroots organization: being started by a refugee, reaching out to her local community. As the vision grows and the projects fl ourish, Women Across Borders has become a larger entity, drawing in volunteers and kindred spirits from all over Durban.
